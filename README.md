# [clickstorm] Convert images to Webp

Clickstorm Clear Processed Images is a TYPO3 extension that stores png and jpg images in webp format too (only fileadmin/_processed_ folder). The backend user can delete the webp files with deleting the processed images by a new cache action.

Feel free to test and give feedback.
